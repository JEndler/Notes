# Productivity Framework

## Productivity Guide

Partially based on  [Pmarca's Personal Productivity Guide](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_personal_productivity.html)

### Key Points:
- "Work on whatever is most important or most interesting"
	> don't keep a schedule.

- "Only agree to new commitments when both your head and your heart say yes."

- "**Each night before you go to bed, prepare a 3x5 index card with a short list of 3 to 5 things that you will do the next day.**"

#### Lists
*Keep three and only three lists: a Todo List, a Consume List, and a Later List.*

-> I have my Todo-List in Obsidian.

-> Consume-List in [Chrome](chrome://bookmarks/)

-> Later-List in Obsidian, as a [[Backlog]]

#### Structured Procrastination

[Original Description](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/)

>TL;DR:
>
>The gist of Structured Procrastination is that you should never fight the tendency to procrastinate -- instead, you should use it to your advantage in order to get other things done.
>
>Generally in the course of a day, there is something you have to do that you are not doing because you are procrastinating.

### Deep Work

Things i do to achieve deep work:

- Do not disturb mode on all my devices.
- Listen to either some [High BPM Synth Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4tc9u3295mHYKuJRmPcini) or [Brain.fm](https://brain.fm)
- Have some concrete, actionable goals for the session.
