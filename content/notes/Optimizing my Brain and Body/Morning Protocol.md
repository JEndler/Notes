> Very much work-in-progress.
> Currently trying how much i can adhere to this, and what works.

Roughly based on recommendations by Huberman and Bryan Johnson.

Usually i try to wake up at around ~8:30.

After waking up, I go for a large glass of water (with a little salt). #todo get more electrolytes.
Then I try to get some sunlight into my eyes asap, either by sitting on my roof-terrace, or by going for a quick walk. While doing that, i try to go through my goals for the day.

After the walk, maybe go get some breakfast, and then start a 90min session of deep work.

Within that session, somewhere in the middle, have my first instance of caffeine.

Then, head for about a 1hr workout, either cardio or weightlifting.

Afterwards, do a cold shower.
