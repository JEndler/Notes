title: Optimizing my Brain and Body

## My Journey to optimize my Brain and Body

The Idea for this Section is to loosely collect thoughts, habits and routines that i have found to be helpful in optimizing my brain and body. I do experiment around with a lot of things, and i am not sure if i will stick to all of them. But i will try to keep this section updated with my findings.

What I currently do (and will probably write about down the line):
- Weight Training
- High Protein Diet
- Regular Fasting (1-3 Days)
- Cold Exposure, usually in the form of Cold Showers
- Regular 8 Hours of Sleep ðŸ˜´
- A very structured [Morning Protocol](Morning%20Protocol.md)
