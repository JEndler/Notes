# Book Notes

I'm trying to get back into the rythm of reading more.

My plan is to write some brief notes about most things i read.
The Idea here is to write about the books in a way i would tell a friend, in a very lightheartet and short manner :)

### Content Map
[Designing Data-Intensive Applications](Designing%20Data-Intensive%20Applications.md)
> Great book to learn about the inner workings of modern data systems.
> Very easy-to-understand, while still interesting :)

[Outliers](Outliers.md)
> Great collection of short stories about all sorts of outliers.
