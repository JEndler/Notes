# _index

This is the place for whatever occupies my mind. *My fully-online second brain* üß†

I take notes because I have too many tabs open in my 5 MB brain :‚Äô)

**Warning: This website is forever a work in progress! Some notes may have weird formatting too + broken links.**

### Why am i even publishing my Notes:

> ‚Äú[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Hamming
